### Languages Used

-   [PYTHON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
3. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

## Development process

- I started the program and repository by using the [gitpod template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) provided by the Code Insitute.  
- Then I regularly staged my changes using the command `git add <filename>` and then committed the staged changes to my local repository using `git commit -m 'short descriptive message here'`. 
- Finally, I would push the commits from my local repository up to the Github repository using the command `git push`.
- With every push, Github automatically deploys my latest commit from the 'main' branch to the Github pages.

## Deployment 

### Github Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CassJBeckford/LoveSandwiches)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Main Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com/CassJBeckford/LoveSandwiches/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages) in the "GitHub Pages" section.


### Forking the Github repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CassJBeckford/LoveSandwiches)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a local clone 

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CassJBeckford/LoveSandwiches)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
